/** \brief A data type for version numbers.
 *
 * This class provides a data type for version numbers. Think of it
 * as a \e QString which provides special behavior for version
 * numbers in the six relational operators (\<, \<=, \>, \>=, ==, !=).
 *
 * The behavior of the relational operators is similar to the behavior
 * of RPM when comparing versions. "Similar" means that it is \e not
 * \e equal! See http://rpm.org/wiki/PackagerDocs/Dependencies for a
 * good description of the algorithm used by RPM to determinate
 * version ordering.
 *
 * You can assign values of the type \e QString and even \e qint64
 * (which will be converted to a QString) and of course of the
 * type \e %VersionNumber itself
 * to it. You can use the assignment operator or the constructor
 * for initiation. The data type is made available to QMetaType and
 * is this way available in for example QVariant. If you want to use
 * it in in non-template based functions like \e queued signal
 * and slot connections, do something like
 * <tt>int id = qRegisterMetaType<VersionNumber>("VersionNumber");</tt>
 * at the begin of your main function.
 * This will register the type also for this use case. <tt>id</tt>
 * will contain the type identifier used by QMetaObject. However,
 * for most cases <tt>id</tt> isn't intresting.
 *
 * You can convert to a string with toString(). This function returns
 * always exactly the string which was used to initialize this object.
 *
 * To compare version numbers, the QString is segmented into small
 * parts. See http://rpm.org/wiki/PackagerDocs/Dependencies for details.
 * The algorithm of \e %VersionNumber differs in some points from the
 * algorithm of RPM:
 * \li It accepts \e all strings, also with special characters.
 * \li You can use not only "." but also "-" as often as you want. (Each
 *     new dash separates a new part in the number.)
 * \li You can safely use special characters. If they aren't "." or "-",
 *     then they are treated as normal characters. The very last
 *     segmentation (e.g. "12#rc1" to "12", "#", "rc", "1") does not only
 *     differ between QChar::isDigit() and QChar::isLetter (like RPM does), but has
 *     a third category for characters who are neither digit nor letter.
 * \li The very first occurrence of ":" is treated as separator for the epoch.
 *     Each following occurrence of ":" is treated as normal character.
