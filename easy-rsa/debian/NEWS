easy-rsa (3.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The version 3 of easy-rsa is not backward compatible with the previous
  version, regarding the syntax and commands. Essentially, all scripts has
  been removed, and there is now only one script, named 'easyrsa', that acts
  as a swissknife.

  Apart from the scripts layout, there are some notable changes in the design
  of the software:

     * nsCertType extensions are no longer included by default. Use of such
       "Netscape" attributes have been deprecated upstream and their use is
       discouraged. Configure `EASYRSA_NS_SUPPORT` in vars if you want to enable
       this legacy behavior.

       Notably, this is important for OpenVPN deployments relying on the
       `--ns-cert-type` directive. Either have OpenVPN use the preferred
       `--remote-cert-tls` option, or enable legacy NS extensions.

     * The default request Subject (or DN, Distinguished Name) includes just the
       commonName. This is more suitable for VPNs and environments that don't wish
       to include info about the Country/State/City/Org/OU in certs. Configure
       `EASYRSA_DN` in vars if you want to enable the legacy behavior.

     * The 3.0 release lacks PKCS#11 (smartcard/token) support. This is anticipated
       to be supported in a future point-release to target each platform's need.

     * The -utf8 option has been added for all supported commands.  This should be
       backwards compatible with ASCII strings.

     * The default private key encryption has been changed from 3des to aes256.

  Please, read the documentation provided in /usr/share/doc/easy-rsa/doc, and
  specifically, the EasyRSA-Upgrade-Notes.md, from where the notable changes
  list upwards is extracted.
